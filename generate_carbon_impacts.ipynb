      "Potatoes have a low carbon footprint as they are primarily grown via photosynthesis and have minimal transportation impact. However, Daeji (which I assume is some form of pork) has a higher carbon footprint due to the emissions from pig farming. Raw ingredients typically have a lower carbon footprint compared to processed ones like mayonnaise. Whole eggs also have a relatively low carbon footprint. However, almonds have a moderately high carbon footprint due to their water and land usage, as well as transportation emissions if they are not locally sourced. Overall, the meal's carbon impact is relatively low, but the almonds and pork contribute to the score being slightly away from neutral.\n",
      "The carbon impact score for this meal is 1. On one hand, potatoes have a relatively low carbon impact, especially if they are sourced locally and organically. However, the inclusion of Daeji (which is a type of Korean pork) in the salad increases its carbon impact significantly. Additionally, almonds and mayonnaise both have moderate to high carbon impacts. Overall, this meal's carbon impact is neither very high nor very low, but it could be improved by substituting the Daeji with a plant-based protein source and using ingredients with lower carbon impacts.\n",

      "Potatoes have a relatively low carbon impact compared to other types of meat and dairy products. Yoghurt and curd type plain also have a relatively lower carbon impact than other types of milk and milk products. However, Daeji can be a high carbon impact ingredient, depending on how it was produced, and raisins can also have a higher carbon impact due to their long transportation distances.

      "The carbon impact score is 2. \n",

      "Potatoes have a relatively low carbon footprint, as they can be grown in most climates without requiring extensive resources. Yoghurt and curd can have a moderate carbon impact, depending on factors such as whether they are made from dairy or non-dairy sources, and how far they have traveled to reach the consumer. Raisins also have a moderate carbon impact, as they require energy and resources to produce and transport. Daeji (which I assume to be raw pork) has a higher carbon impact, as meat production is generally more resource-intensive than plant-based ingredients. Overall, this meal is relatively low in carbon impact due to the focus on plant-based ingredients.\n",
      "The carbon impact score is 5. \n",

Yoghurt and curd type are both dairy products which have a higher carbon impact than plant-based options, but on the whole, this meal has a fairly low carbon impact.
